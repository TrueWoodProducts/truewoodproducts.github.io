    <h1>True Wood – Natural Handmade Wooden Products</h1>
    <p>
      Every True Wood board is one of a kind. We don’t use conveyor belts, templates, or mass production.
      Everything begins with a single piece of hardwood — oak, walnut, or ash. We carefully select each cut,
      respecting the grain, color, and natural texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      No glue. No chemicals. No shortcuts. Only wood, oil, and the touch of a craftsman’s hand. Every board is crafted
      individually, infused with warmth and story. Walnut, in particular, is our pride — each piece is as unique as a
      fingerprint, never to be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At True Wood, we believe in creating pieces that are not just tools, but companions in your kitchen — full of life and meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Care for Your True Wood Board</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hand wash only. Use warm water, a soft sponge, and a drop of mild soap if needed.</li>
      <li>Never soak or put in a dishwasher.</li>
      <li>Dry upright and avoid drying near heat sources.</li>
      <li>Oil regularly — once a month with food-safe oils like linseed, coconut, almond, or board conditioner.</li>
      <li>Store in a dry place, away from direct sunlight or heat.</li>
    </ul>
